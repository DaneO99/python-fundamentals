# 2D Collections

This directory contains examples of working with two-dimensional data structures in Python.

## Files

- **2d-collections.py** - Demonstrates how to work with nested collections (lists, tuples, sets) to create 2D data structures. Examples include:
  - Creating a grocery matrix with fruits, vegetables, and meats
  - Building a numeric keypad layout using tuples
  - Iterating through 2D structures with nested loops

## Concepts Covered

- Nested lists, tuples, and sets
- 2D data structure indexing with `[row][column]` notation
- Nested loops for traversing 2D collections
- Practical examples like organizing data in matrix format
