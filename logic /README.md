# Logic and Decision Making

This section covers all aspects of logical operations and decision-making in Python, from basic if statements to advanced conditional expressions.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- Basic conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Boolean logic operators (and, or, not)
- Conditional expressions (ternary operators)
- Complex logical conditions
- Decision-making patterns in programming

## 📁 Exercises in This Section

### [If Statements](./ifstatements/)
Master the fundamentals of conditional logic with if/elif/else statements.

### [Logic Operators](./logicoperators/)
Learn to combine conditions using AND, OR, and NOT operators.

### [Conditionals](./conditionals/)
Explore ternary operators and conditional expressions for concise code.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Basic Conditionals
```python
if condition:
    # Execute if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Execute if another_condition is True
else:
    # Execute if all conditions are False
```

### Logic Operators
```python
# AND - Both conditions must be True
if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("Can drive")

# OR - At least one condition must be True
if is_weekend or is_holiday:
    print("No work today")

# NOT - Reverse the boolean value
if not is_raining:
    print("Good weather for a walk")
```

### Conditional Expressions
```python
# Ternary operator for concise conditionals
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
result = "Pass" if score >= 60 else "Fail"
```

## 🚀 Learning Path

1. **Start with If Statements** - Learn basic conditional logic
2. **Move to Logic Operators** - Combine multiple conditions
3. **Explore Conditionals** - Write more concise conditional code

## 🔗 Next Steps

After mastering logic and decision making, you'll be ready for:
- [Loops](../loops/) - Combine conditions with iteration
- [Functions](../functions/) - Create reusable decision-making logic
- [Error Handling](../exceptions/) - Handle unexpected conditions

Decision-making is fundamental to programming - every program needs to make choices based on different conditions!
